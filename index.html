                    <p>(it's pronounced like the bread)</p>
                    <p>I grew up in Seattle and moved to Chicago in 2007 for college. I'm still a little in denial about living in the (flat, cold in the winter, Satan's damp armpit in the summer) Midwest, but I'm still here eleven years later, so I guess I'm a Chicagoan now. I've even registered to vote here and am excited to actually go to a polling place for once!</p>
                    <p>In addition to coding and caring a whole lot about automation and never hardcoding anything because hardcoding can and will break your entire process irreperably when given half a chance, I run (slowly), knit (less slowly), play video games (poorly), draw (even MORE poorly), and play and run tabletop games. Perhaps unsurprisingly, all of these wrist-heavy hobbies + majoring in violin in college means my wrists are barely hanging on and will probably pop out of my body and escape at some point.</p>
                    <p>My current living situation is sharing a 1br apartment with my sweet dumb roommate, Sgt. Nubbins McBeef (pictured here; he's more photogenic than I am and knows how to work his angles). He is very very sweet and forgiving of all sorts of sins on my part, both real and imagined; the most annoying thing he does is whine if I eat dinner alone instead of sitting on the floor next to his bowl so we can eat together like a family. He is a dumb baby coward most of the time and I give him a hard time about being a chunky fella, but he is a frighteningly efficient murderer and will destroy every rodent that enters our abode. Unfortunately for me and my arachnophobia, he's afraid of spiders and makes me deal with them.</p>
